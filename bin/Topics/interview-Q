what is flutter 
 -------------
Flutter is an open-source UI framework created by Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile (Android & iOS), web, and desktop from a single codebase. It uses Dart as its programming language.

Subscriptions in flutter
-----------------------

A subscription means you are listening to something that keeps sending updates — like a radio or live news. In Flutter, this is usually done using a Stream.


Eg;-
📱 Scenario: Chat App
You’re building a chat app. You want the app to show new messages as they arrive — live.

You can use a subscription to listen to the message stream.


🧠 What This Code Does:
Stream.periodic(...) is faking a new message every 2 seconds.

messageSubscription.listen(...) listens to the stream.

It prints a new message every time one comes.

You can stop it anytime with cancel().

🗝️ What is a Key?
A Key is like a name tag for a widget.

It helps Flutter know which widget is which when things change.


When the UI updates (like list items changing), Flutter uses Keys to figure out:

Which widget to keep

Which to update

Which to remove or add

Without a key, Flutter may get confused and update the wrong widget.




❓ Does every widget have a Key?
👉 No, not every widget has a key.

🧱 By default:
Most widgets don’t need a key. Flutter handles them automatically.

🗝️ When do we add a Key?
You only add a Key when:

Widgets are in a list and can change/move

You want to keep state (like text input)

You're doing animations or drag & drop

You want Flutter to match widgets accurately
  



💡 What is a framework?
A framework is like a ready-made toolbox for building apps.
It gives you the tools, parts, and rules to help you build things faster and easier.

🧱 Example:
Imagine you want to build a house:

Without a framework: You cut the wood, make the bricks, and build everything by yourself.

With a framework: You get ready-made doors, windows, and walls. You just put them together.

🚀 What is Flutter?
Flutter is a framework made by Google.
It helps you build apps for Android, iPhone, Web, and Desktop — all with one code.

It gives you:

Ready-to-use designs (called widgets)

Tools to make the app work

A way to show things on the screen

✅ In simple words:
A framework is a helper kit.
Flutter is a helper kit to make mobile and web apps quickly and easily.
