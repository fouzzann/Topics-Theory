27. WFH/WFO
--------------------------------------------------
  Iam comfortable working both in the office and at home. In the office, I can work closely with my team,
  have quick discussions, and build strong relationships. At home, I have more flexibility, save travel time,
  and focus better on my work. I adjust my work style to match the company’s needs. Whether I work from the office or home,
  I always complete my tasks on time and help my team succeed.

  Example to showcase your adaptability skills
---------------------------------------------------
I am in an institute called Brototype, where we learn by ourselves. 
At first, it was hard because I was used to learning with a teacher. 
In the first week, I found it difficult to manage time and understand things alone. 
But I didn’t give up. I made a simple plan, broke big topics into small parts, and searched for answers. 
Soon, I got better at learning on my own. Now, I can learn new things quickly without much help. 
This has made me better at solving problems."

Challenges faced while working in your project
----------------------------------------------


If You get an extra task along with my daily work
--------------------------------------------------
If I get an extra task along with my daily work, I will first decide which task is more important and urgent. 
Then, I will plan my time well to complete both tasks without distractions. If I don’t understand the extra task, 
I will ask for clarification. I will stay flexible and adjust my work as needed. If possible, 
I will share the task with someone else to get it done faster. My goal is to finish all tasks smoothly and maintain good quality work.
